# CM4044 proj 2

A mini project for CM4044-AI in Chemistry. This is a graded assignment for a CBC year 4 chemistry module in NTU. 

First attempt on using RDkit, sklearn, deepchem to come out with different inputs to feed a regression model. In this project, we extracted molecular descriptors, fingerprints using RDkit. Generate vector embedding using mol2vec model developed by Jaeger et al (1). 

The codes were written in conjunction with my 2 other friends, Ding Jie and Zhi Chao.
